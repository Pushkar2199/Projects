overview -
In this project, a comprehensive Power BI report was developed, featuring five distinct dashboards tailored for executives, marketing, sales, finance, and supply chain departments. The aim was to provide these departments with quick and actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making across markets.

To accomplish this, a thorough analysis was conducted on a dataset consisting of over four million rows of data. The analysis involved various stages, including data gathering, data wrangling, and data modeling, all of which were performed within Power BI.

Power Query was utilized for data transformation tasks, ensuring the data was cleaned, structured, and ready for analysis. Additionally, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was employed to create calculated columns and necessary measures to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

Overall, this project showcased the power of Power BI in handling large volumes of data and transforming it into valuable visualizations and reports, empowering different departments within the organization to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
